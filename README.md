A test/game designed to check response times when feeling drowsy and are unsure if you're fit to drive. This connects to a wheel attachment.

## Why Use Hands On?
First, test if you're fit to drive home. If you must drive home after failing, active the wheel attachment. This attachment will alert you when you let go of the wheel.
